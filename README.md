Hi I'm Rachel!

I'm currently a student at the School of Code. (Cohort 12, April 2022 - August 2022).

Before beginning my journey into tech I was a primary school teacher so I have more transferrable skills than you could count, some of the most important being patience, an enthusiasm for learning and the ability to work with pretty much anybody!

I have learnt an incredible amount since starting the bootcamp, sometimes it's hard to believe that I have only been doing this a few months when I stop to look at what I have created, both in a team and alone, and I look forward to continuing to learn and develop throughout my career.

On my github you can see some of the projects that I have completed since beginning the bootcamp, I have left projects from the start of my journey available as I think that they really highlight how far I have come in such a short amount of time.
